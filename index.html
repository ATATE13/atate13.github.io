        <p>I grew up in the Orlando area, but originally from a small town in northern Illinois. I am the youngest
                of four children. I love spending time with my family, especially my five nieces and nephews. I enjoy reading,
                traveling and have found a new love for coding.</p>
        <p>My background is in healthcare, I graduated from University of Central Florida in 2008 with a bachelorâ€™s in science for Health
                Information Management. I also completed my certification as a Registered Health Information Manager (RHIA) through
                America Health Information Management Association (AHIMA). I also recently completed my Certified Revenue Cycle
                Representative certification through Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA). I have worked at
                Orlando Health for sixteen years, and thirteen of those in Revenue Integrity. I am currently an Assistant
                Manager of Charge Management and Education. My plan or goal is to combine the many aspects i have learned in my
                healthcare career into my new love for web development and coding. </p>
